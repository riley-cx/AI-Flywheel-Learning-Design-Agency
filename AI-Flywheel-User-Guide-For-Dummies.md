## Multi-Agent Coordination: Orchestrating Your Squad

### The Agency CLI: Your Command Center

**Basic Commands:**

```bash
# Start the agency
./agency-cli

# Common commands you'll use daily:
> help                    # Show all available commands
> status all              # Check health of all agents
> status [agent-name]     # Check specific agent
> active tasks            # See what agents are working on
> recent conversations    # See recent agent communications
> dashboard               # Open web dashboard
```

**Advanced Commands:**

```bash
# Workflow commands
> new course              # Start course creation workflow
> improve course [id]     # Start course improvement workflow
> analyze performance     # Run performance analysis
> quarterly planning      # Start strategic planning

> alerts                  # Show active alerts
```

### Coordinating Multiple Agents: The Art

**Pattern 1: Sequential Workflow (Waterfall)**

Use when: Tasks must happen in order

**Example: Course Launch**
```
1. Market Research Analyst ‚Üí Research market
2. Chief Learning Strategist ‚Üí Decide to proceed
3. Learning Designer ‚Üí Design course
4. Quality Assurance Specialist ‚Üí Review and approve
5. Chief Learning Strategist ‚Üí Approve launch
```

**Your command:**
```bash
> launch course workflow

# The system handles the sequence automatically
# You approve at key gates
```

---

**Pattern 2: Parallel Workflow (Simultaneous)**

Use when: Tasks can happen at the same time

**Example: Student Experience Optimization**
```
Parallel tracks:
‚îú‚îÄ Behavioral Scientist ‚Üí Design motivation interventions
‚îú‚îÄ Experience Designer ‚Üí Redesign UI/UX
‚îú‚îÄ Community Manager ‚Üí Plan engagement campaign
‚îî‚îÄ Data Analyst ‚Üí Set up measurement

Then converge:
‚îî‚îÄ Chief Experience Strategist ‚Üí Integrate all improvements
```

**Your command:**
```bash
> optimize student experience

Coordinating parallel workstreams...
‚îú‚îÄ Track 1: Behavioral interventions ‚è≥
‚îú‚îÄ Track 2: UX improvements ‚è≥
‚îú‚îÄ Track 3: Community engagement ‚è≥
‚îî‚îÄ Track 4: Analytics setup ‚úÖ

You'll be notified when all tracks complete.
```

---

**Pattern 3: Collaborative Workflow (Pair Work)**

Use when: Two agents need to work together closely

**Example: Fixing Engagement Issues**
```
Behavioral Scientist + Learning Designer
‚îî‚îÄ Diagnose problem together
‚îî‚îÄ Co-create solution
‚îî‚îÄ Iterate based on feedback
```

**Your command:**
```bash
> collaborate "Behavioral Scientist" "Learning Designer" "Fix low engagement in Module 3"

ü§ù COLLABORATION SESSION STARTED

Behavioral Scientist: Analyzing motivation barriers...
Learning Designer: Reviewing instructional design...

Joint diagnosis:
- Problem: Cognitive overload (9 concepts in one lesson)
- Contributing factor: No clear relevance to student goals
- Low confidence in ability to succeed

Proposed solution:
- BS: Add implementation intention exercise ("I will use X in Y situation")
- LD: Split lesson into 3 smaller chunks with practice between
- BS: Include success stories from similar students
- LD: Make first exercise extremely easy (quick win)

Estimated impact: +25% engagement

Implement? [Y/N]
```

---

**Pattern 4: Emergency Response (All Hands)**

Use when: Critical issue needs immediate attention

**Example: Course Has Major Bug**

```
> emergency "Course 'ML Fundamentals' has broken video links - 500 students affected"

üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

Assembling crisis team...
‚îú‚îÄ Chief Learning Strategist (Incident Commander)
‚îú‚îÄ Data Analyst (Impact assessment)
‚îú‚îÄ Experience Designer (Technical fix)
‚îú‚îÄ Community Manager (Student communication)
‚îú‚îÄ Quality Assurance Specialist (Root cause)

[2 min] Data Analyst: 487 students affected, 23 support tickets
[3 min] QA Specialist: Root cause identified - CDN migration broke links
[4 min] Experience Designer: Fix deployed, testing...
[6 min] Experience Designer: ‚úÖ Fix confirmed working
[7 min] Community Manager: Apology email drafted
[8 min] Chief Learning Strategist: Review email ‚Üí APPROVED

[9 min] Community Manager: Email sent to 487 students
[10 min] Data Analyst: Monitoring resolved ticket rate...

INCIDENT RESOLVED
Duration: 10 minutes
Impact: 487 students (downtime: 2 hours)
Status: Monitoring for 24 hours
Post-mortem scheduled: Tomorrow 10am
```

**What just happened:**
- You declared an emergency
- Chief Learning Strategist became Incident Commander
- All relevant agents mobilized automatically
- They coordinated to resolve in 10 minutes
- You just supervised (the team executed)

## Troubleshooting: When Things Go Wrong

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: Agent Not Responding**

**Symptom:**
```
> status "Data Analyst"
‚ùå Data Analyst: Unresponsive (last seen 10 minutes ago)
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check agent logs
> logs "Data Analyst"

# Common causes:
# 1. Agent crashed ‚Üí Restart it
> restart "Data Analyst"

# 2. Agent stuck on task ‚Üí Cancel task and restart
> cancel task [task-id]
> restart "Data Analyst"

# 3. Database connection issue ‚Üí Check database
> check database connection
```

---

**Issue 2: Agents Giving Inconsistent Answers**

**Symptom:**
You asked the same question twice, got different answers

**Solution:**
```bash
# This is often due to memory not persisting
# Check memory status
> check memory "Data Analyst"

# If memory not persisting:
> consolidate memory "Data Analyst"

# Force memory refresh
> reload memory "Data Analyst"

# If issue persists, check configuration
> config show memory
```

---

**Issue 3: Workflow Stuck (Agents Waiting on Each Other)**

**Symptom:**
```
> active tasks
Task: course-dev-2024-001
Status: STUCK (waiting 2 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ Learning Designer: Waiting for Behavioral Scientist
‚îî‚îÄ Behavioral Scientist: Waiting for Learning Designer
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# View conversation
> show conversation conv-course-dev-2024-001

# You'll see circular dependency or unclear request
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Cancel the stuck task
> cancel task course-dev-2024-001

# Restart with clearer instructions
> new course
# [Provide more specific requirements this time]
```

---

**Issue 4: Quality Review Failed (Course Rejected)**

**Symptom:**
```
‚ùå QA Specialist: REJECTED course-2024-045
   Critical issues: 3
   - Missing alt text on 5 images
   - Assessment question 7 doesn't match objective
   - Cognitive load too high in Lesson 4 (9 concepts)
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# View detailed feedback
> show qa report course-2024-045

# Auto-fix if possible
> auto fix course-2024-045

# Or assign back to Learning Designer
> assign "Learning Designer" "Fix issues in course-2024-045 per QA feedback"

# Track progress
> status course-2024-045
```

---

**Issue 5: Too Many Alerts (Alert Fatigue)**

**Symptom:**
Your dashboard shows 50 alerts, you're overwhelmed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Prioritize alerts
> alerts priority high

# Configure alert thresholds
> config alerts
# Set: Only alert on >10% variance (not every 1% change)

# Batch review
> alerts summary
# Shows aggregated trends instead of individual alerts

# Delegate monitoring
> delegate monitoring "Data Analyst"
# Data Analyst will only alert you on critical issues
```

---

### Error Messages Decoded

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- **What it means:** Agent making too many requests too fast
- **Solution:** Wait 60 seconds, or increase rate limit in config

**"Permission denied"**
- **What it means:** Agent trying to access data they're not allowed to
- **Solution:** Check RBAC settings, ensure agent has correct role

**"Conversation not found"**
- **What it means:** Referring to a conversation that doesn't exist or expired
- **Solution:** Start a new conversation, check conversation ID

**"Memory overflow"**
- **What it means:** Short-term memory is full
- **Solution:** Run `> consolidate memory [agent-name]` to move to long-term storage

**"Timeout waiting for response"**
- **What it means:** Agent didn't respond within expected time
- **Solution:** Check if agent is overloaded, restart if needed

### Tip 2: Weekly Review (30 Minutes)

**Every Friday:**
```bash
> weekly review

# Generates comprehensive report:
```

```
üìä WEEK OF OCT 21-25, 2024 - PERFORMANCE REVIEW

PROGRESS ON GOALS:
Q4 Revenue Goal: $520K
‚îú‚îÄ Week progress: $6,234 ‚úÖ (+8% vs target)
‚îú‚îÄ On track: YES

Approve weekly plan? [Y/N]
```

---

### Tip 3: Delegate Effectively

**Don't micromanage. Set clear goals and let agents work.**

**BAD (Micromanaging):**
```
> ask "Learning Designer" "Create Lesson 1.1 with exactly 4 learning objectives,
  2 videos of 5 minutes each, 1 quiz with 5 questions, use blue color scheme..."
```

**GOOD (Clear goal, agent autonomy):**
```
> ask "Learning Designer" "Design Module 1 for 'AI Safety' course. Target audience:
  ML engineers. Learning outcome: Understand key AI safety challenges.
  Apply your expertise for engagement and accessibility. Coordinate with
  Behavioral Scientist for motivation tactics."
```

**The difference:**
- ‚ùå Micromanaging specifies **HOW** (you're doing their job)
- ‚úÖ Delegating specifies **WHAT** outcome you want (they use their expertise)

---

### Tip 4: Use Templates for Common Tasks

**Create saved prompts:**
```bash
> save prompt "new-course-fast-track" "Quick course creation for trending topics:
  1. Market Research: Validate demand and pricing
  2. Learning Designer: Create outline (15 hours max)
  3. Fast-track QA review
  4. Launch within 2 weeks
  Target: Capitalize on trending topics quickly"

# Use it later:
> run prompt "new-course-fast-track" topic="Multimodal AI with GPT-4V"
```

**More template ideas:**
- `quarterly-review`: Run full quarterly analysis
- `fix-low-engagement`: Standard engagement troubleshooting
- `launch-campaign`: Community engagement campaign
- `emergency-fix`: Crisis response protocol

---

### Tip 5: Monitor What Matters (Don't Drown in Data)

**Set up your executive dashboard with ONLY these metrics:**

```bash
> dashboard configure

Select metrics to display:
‚úÖ Revenue (vs goal)
‚úÖ Active students
‚úÖ Course completion rate
‚úÖ Student satisfaction (NPS)
‚úÖ Community participation
‚úÖ Agent health
‚úÖ Critical alerts only

‚ùå Don't include:
- Low-level metrics (latency, token usage, etc.)
- Vanity metrics (total page views, etc.)
- Metrics you can't act on
```

**Why:** You're the director, not the operator. Focus on outcomes, not outputs.

---

### Tip 6: Asynchronous Management

**You don't need to be online 24/7. Your agents work while you sleep.**

**Set up automated workflows:**
```bash
> create workflow "daily-health-check"
  Schedule: Every day at 8am
  Actions:
    1. Check all agent health
    2. Review overnight alerts
    3. Generate morning briefing
    4. Email me summary

> create workflow "weekly-report"
  Schedule: Every Friday at 5pm
  Actions:
    1. Compile week's performance
    2. Compare to goals
    3. Identify issues
    4. Draft next week priorities
    5. Email me for review
```

**Set decision rules:**
```bash
> set rule "auto-approve-small-fixes"
  Condition: QA issue severity = MINOR AND estimated_fix_time < 2 hours
  Action: Auto-approve fix and deploy

> set rule "escalate-major-issues"
  Condition: Alert priority = CRITICAL OR revenue_impact > $10K
  Action: Send me SMS immediately
```

**Now you're working ON the agency, not IN the agency.**

---

### Tip 7: Learn from Your Agents

**Your agents have expertise. Ask them to teach you:**

```bash
> ask "Behavioral Scientist" "Teach me the top 5 principles for increasing
  student motivation that we use in our courses. Explain each with an example
  from our actual courses."

> ask "Learning Designer" "What are the common mistakes you see in course
  designs that I should watch for? Give me a checklist."

> ask "Data Analyst" "Explain what 'statistical significance' means in the
  context of our A/B tests. How should I interpret p-values when you present
  results to me?"
```

**Become a better director by learning from your team.**

### Tip 8: Strategic 1-on-1s with Chiefs

**Every month, have strategic discussions with each Chief:**

```bash
> schedule 1on1 "Chief Learning Strategist"

Topics to discuss:
1. Big picture: Are we on track with annual goals?
2. Strategic opportunities: What are we missing?
3. Resource needs: Do you have what you need to succeed?
4. Team performance: How are other agents performing?
5. My performance: How can I be a better director?

Example conversation:
You: "Looking at the big picture, are we on track for our annual goal of
     $5M revenue and 10,000 students?"

Chief Learning Strategist: "Revenue: YES, tracking 103% to goal.
     Students: CONCERN, tracking 94% to goal.

     Root cause: Customer acquisition cost increased 22% since Q2.
     Our organic growth slowed while paid ads got more expensive.

     Recommendation: Double down on student referral program. Our data shows
     referred students have 2.3x lifetime value. I recommend investing $50K
     in referral incentives to close the gap.

     Should I coordinate with Community Strategist to design the program?"

You: "Yes, proceed. Let me know the plan by Friday."
```

### Tip 9: Celebrate Wins (Team Morale)

**Even AI agents appreciate recognition:**

```bash
> celebrate "Learning Designer designed 3 courses this month, all approved
  first-pass. This is exceptional work and reflects their commitment to quality.
  The efficiency gains allow us to move faster on market opportunities."

# System broadcasts celebration to all agents
# Learning Designer's "motivation score" increases
# Other agents see what excellence looks like
```

**Why this matters:**
- Reinforces desired behaviors
- Creates positive culture
- Sets standards for excellence

### Tip 10: Think 10x, Not 10%

**Don't just optimize existing processes. Reimagine what's possible.**

**10% thinking:**
```
"How can we improve course completion from 75% to 80%?"
```

**10x thinking:**
```
"What if we could guarantee 95%+ completion by completely reimagining
the learning experience? What would that look like?

> brainstorm "Chief Experience Strategist" "Chief Learning Strategist"
  "Behavioral Scientist"

  Topic: Design a learning experience that achieves 95%+ completion
  Constraints: Remove all constraints. Blue-sky thinking.
  Deliverable: 3 radical ideas we could test"
```

**Your agents can explore possibilities humans might not consider.**
