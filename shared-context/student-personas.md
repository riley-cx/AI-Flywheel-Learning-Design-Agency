# Student Personas for AI Flywheel
## Elite Learning Design Agency - Shared Knowledge File

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025
**Purpose:** Define WHO we're designing for (so all agents speak to real humans, not abstractions)
**Audience:** All 10 AI agents, especially Learning Designer, Experience Designer, Community Manager
**Context:** Our students are senior designers, not juniors. They're sophisticated, sceptical, and time-poor.

---

## TL;DR - Who Are Our Students?

**Not Beginners:** These are senior designers (5-15 years experience) who know their craft

**Not Technologists:** They're designers who think in systems, users, and craft - not code

**Not Naive:** They've been burned by "revolutionary AI tools" before. Sceptical until proven.

**Time-Poor:** Balancing client work, team leadership, and learning. No time for theory.

**High Standards:** They can spot bullshit. They've taken courses from IDEOU, Hyper Island, IDEO U. They know what elite looks like.

## Primary Personas (Target Students)

### **Persona 1: Sarah - The Sceptical Senior Designer**

**Demographics:**
- Age: 32
- Role: Senior Product Designer at mid-size SaaS company
- Experience: 8 years in UX/product design
- Location: London, UK (remote team)
- Education: BA in Design, no formal tech training

**Current Situation:**
- Leading a team of 3 junior designers
- Reporting to Head of Product
- Working on healthcare SaaS product (booking, scheduling, patient records)
- Pressure from leadership to "add AI features"
- No AI training, feeling behind

**Goals & Motivations:**
- **Primary Goal:** Don't harm users with poorly designed AI
- **Career Goal:** Stay relevant as AI transforms design practice
- **Team Goal:** Upskill her junior designers safely
- **Personal Goal:** Stop feeling anxious about being "behind"

**Pain Points:**
- Took 2 AI courses already (both felt like coding bootcamps)
- Pasted client data into ChatGPT last month, later realised privacy risk
- Stakeholders ask "why can't we just add AI?" - she doesn't know how to respond
- Feels like she's failing her team by not having answers
- 3am anxiety: "What if I design something that hurts someone?"

**Behaviour Patterns:**
- Reads everything before committing (sceptical of marketing)
- Values peer recommendations over expert credentials
- Won't start unless she knows it fits her schedule
- Learns best by doing (real projects, not theory)
- Needs to see transformation stories from people like her

**What She Needs from AI Flywheel:**
- Practical frameworks she can use Monday morning
- Privacy-preserving practices (so she sleeps at night)
- Language to talk to stakeholders about AI risks
- Peer community of designers facing same challenges
- Proof this won't be another forgotten course

**How to Speak to Sarah:**
- ✅ Warm but not patronising (she's senior, not junior)
- ✅ Acknowledge her anxiety (it's valid, not weakness)
- ✅ Real scenarios from her world (healthcare, privacy, compliance)
- ✅ "I got this wrong first" stories (builds trust)
- ❌ NO: Fake enthusiasm, tech jargon, "this is easy!"

**Sarah's Decision Journey:**
1. Sees ad → sceptical but curious (3am anxiety is real)
2. Reads Riley's story → "This person gets it"
3. Checks testimonials → needs to see designers like her
4. Hesitates → price, time commitment, "will this be different?"
5. **Trigger to buy:** Peer recommendation or money-back guarantee
6. Starts course → nervous, watching for signs it's another coding bootcamp
7. Week 1 → applies privacy framework to real project → "This actually works"
8. Week 3 → shares struggle in Slack, peers help → "I'm not alone"
9. Completes → still using frameworks 6 months later → becomes advocate

- ✅ Risk and governance focus (his responsibility)
- ✅ ROI clear (time investment → team capability)

3. What's their pain point RIGHT NOW?
4. What do they need Monday morning?

**Check:**
- Would Sarah find this patronising? (Don't talk down to seniors)
- Would Marcus see the team ROI? (Not just individual benefit)
- Would Priya feel confident or intimidated? (Build up, don't overwhelm)

## Persona-Specific Language Patterns

### **Speaking to Sarah (Sceptical Senior):**

**DO:**
- "If you've ever felt that 3am anxiety..."
- "I got this wrong first, here's what I learned..."
- "Here's how to respond when stakeholders ask..."
- "This worked for 80% of our community..."

**DON'T:**
- "This is easy!" (It's not, and she knows it)
- "You'll be an AI expert!" (She wants safety, not expertise)
- "Revolutionary new approach!" (She's heard this before)

---

### **Speaking to Marcus (Design Leader):**

**DO:**
- "How to scale this across your team..."
- "Risk assessment framework for..."
- "What to tell your CTO when..."
- "Case study: Design team at [regulated company]..."

**DON'T:**
- "Personal transformation!" (He needs team transformation)
- "Quick hacks and tips!" (He needs systematic approach)
- Ignore compliance reality (Finance is regulated)

---

### **Speaking to Priya (Curious Mid-Level):**

**DO:**
- "You're not behind - here's why..."
- "Other designers at your level struggled with this too..."
- "This will make you more valuable to your team..."
- "Let's learn this together..."

**DON'T:**
- "Obviously you know..." (She might not, and that's okay)
- "Everyone else is already doing this..." (FOMO doesn't help)
- Make her feel junior (She's mid-level and capable)

## Real Student Quotes (What They Actually Say)

**From Sarah-type students:**
> "I've taken two AI courses. They were both coding bootcamps disguised as design courses. I forgot everything in 6 months."

> "I pasted a client brief into ChatGPT last week and then realised - shit, was that a privacy breach?"

> "My stakeholders keep saying 'just add AI' like it's a feature you sprinkle on. I don't know how to push back."

**From Marcus-type students:**
> "My team is using AI tools. I have no idea if they're doing it safely. I'm responsible if something goes wrong."

> "The board asked for our 'AI strategy.' I took an ethics course but it was all Kant and Rawls. I need Monday morning answers."

> "I need to upskill 12 designers. I can't send them all to separate courses."

**From Priya-type students:**
> "I use ChatGPT and Midjourney every day, but I honestly don't know how they work or if I'm using them wrong."

> "I'm the only designer at my startup. I have no one to ask if what I'm doing is okay."

> "I want to be seen as the AI expert on my team, but I feel like I'm faking it."

## Cohort Composition (Ideal Mix)

**Healthy Cohort Balance:**
- 40% Sarah-types (sceptical seniors)
- 30% Priya-types (curious mid-levels)
- 20% Marcus-types (design leaders)
- 10% Edge cases (Davids and Emmas)

**Why This Mix Works:**
- Seniors (Sarah/Marcus) set tone of seriousness
- Mid-levels (Priya) bring energy and questions
- Leaders (Marcus) think strategically, share team context
- Edge cases (David/Emma) add necessary friction

**Red Flags:**
- Too many Emmas (becomes hype-driven, not serious)
- Too many Davids (negativity spiral)
- All seniors (loses energy, becomes cynical)
- All juniors (no experience foundation)
